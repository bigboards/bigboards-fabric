            Glad you could make it to the party. Unfortunately, this device has not been linked to a cluster yet. In
            order to make it work, you can do one of two things:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <li><p class="md-body-1">
                Go to the central platform and register this device with a cluster
            </p></li>
            <li>
                <p class="md-body-1">
                    Call the api on this host with the following body:
                </p>
                <pre>
{
    "name": "the name of your cluster",
    "key": "the cluster key",
    "role": "'server' or 'client'",
    "servers": 2,
    "nodes": [
        "address of another node",
        "address of another node",
        ...
    ]
}
                </pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
